# Logistics Wizard Overview

Logistics Wizard reimagines supply chain operations through a cloud-native architecture and services.

Today many companies use on-premises applications such as [Enterprise Resource Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) systems to manage the supply chain. Logistics Wizard simulates an existing ERP system and enhances it with applications to improve visibility and agility. The provided ERP system implements a very small subset of features found in real-world ERP systems. The goal here is not to focus on ERP but rather showcase several common cloud implementation patterns such as: hybrid cloud, microservices, and data analytics that can be reused when building or enhancing enterprise applications.

One key scenario demonstrates how a supply chain can be made more agile during significant weather events. For any company with multiple distribution centers, retail stores and in-transit shipments, quickly adapting the supply chain to changing weather conditions can reduce shipment delays and operational cost.

## Try Logistics Wizard

Use the [walkthrough](WALKTHROUGH.md) to view and understand the features of Logistics Wizard.

## Deploy Logistics Wizard

You can deploy your own Logistics Wizard in the following ways:
  * Use the [Logistics Wizard Toolchain][toolchain_github_url] to automatically deploy the application as Cloud Foundry microservices. (Recommended)
  * Follow [instructions](Deploy_Microservices_Cloud_Foundry_Docker.md) to manually deploy the ERP & Controller as Cloud Foundry Docker Apps.
  * Enable [container-to-container](Enable_C2C_Networking.md) networking to keep communication private.

## Architecture

Logistics Wizard consists of several microservices.

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

* [logistics-wizard-erp][erp_github_url] defines the API used by Logistics Wizard to simulate data accessed from an ERP system. The simulator is a Node.js application connected to a database. The API manages users (supply chain managers and retail store managers), distribution centers, retail stores and shipments.

* [logistics-wizard-webui][webui_github_url] provides a dashboard to view ongoing shipments and alerts. There is no log-in or user credentials to use the deployed applications. Instead a unique demo ID is assigned to any new user trying the application. Behind each demo ID, Logistics Wizard creates an isolated environment with a default set of business users, distribution centers, retail stores and shipments.

* [logistics-wizard-recommendation][recommendation_github_url] makes shipment recommendations based on weather conditions. It is a set of IBM Cloud Functions to retrieve current weather conditions and generate new shipment recommendations. These recommendations can then be converted into orders.

* [logistics-wizard-controller][controller_github_url] acts as the main controller for interaction between the services. It receives requests from the user interface and routes them to the ERP or the weather recommendation service.
